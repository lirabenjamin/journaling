271 & Let's delve into the topic of negativity. The framework we'll use involves identifying negative thought patterns: Generalizations (statements like 'All people are \_\_\_\_.'), Assumptions ('There are haters everywhere.'), and Beliefs ('The world is going to hell.'). Reflect on the following questions: Can you identify places of 'good' in your life right now? If you're going through a challenging or dark season, how might you gain perspective? Are there instances where you tend to generalize, e.g., 'All \_\_\_ people are \_\_\_,' and where do you do this? What 'negativity bandwagons' do you regularly join? Do you feel capable of abstaining from participating when others are attacking? Have you intentionally walked away from negativity recently? Do you withhold your voice or avoid sharing your message due to fear of criticism or backlash? Can you see yourself as a solution-oriented leader within your circle of friends and family? & 20240319104726 &       temp1 \\
